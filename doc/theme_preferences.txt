Dotfiles: Theme Preferences

This file contains a list of standard Base16 themes that I like. They are
categorized by the type of theme and by how much I like them.

NOTE: these lists might not be accurate (or might become inaccurate in the
future), since they were tested only on output from some terminal commands and
some .vim files (but without the base16-vim plugin, which completely changes how
.vim files look). In other words, I probably did not correctly evaluate how any
files will look in (neo)vim with any of the available base16 themes, and I
didn't even try to look at many types of files that I might be looking at often
in the future.

TODO: Update these lists at some point in light of the above note.
