- Check out some of these nice themes, and possibly make Base16 themes out of
  them:

- Further synchronize vim, tmux, and zshrc colors by defining all specific
  color settings according to some shell variables for primary colors,
  accent colors, etc.
- Try out the "font stuff" described above.



Overview of Base16
------------------
All the themes I use for my terminal setup come from Base16, which according
to its Github page is "[a]n architecture for building themes based on carefully
chosen syntax highlighting using a base of sixten colors." The main
benefits of using Base16 are:

- several standard themes are provided out-of-the-box;
- themes are made with syntax highlighting in mind;
- plugins exist to apply Base16 themes to many popular applications; and
- these plugins are often able to automatically sync the themes in use.

A very brief background about the components of the Base16 architecture:

- A "scheme file" is a file containing the colors for a given theme.
- A "template file" is a template that dictates how theme files should be
  formatted for a specific application. For instance, there exist template files
  for emacs (which are formatted the way an emacs theme file would be), vim
  (which are formatted the way vim colorscheme files would be), etc.
- A "builder" is a program that "plugs in" the colors from a scheme file 
  into a template file to provide a theme file for a given application.



Our Base16 Setup
----------------
We currently make use of the following Base16 plugins:

- base16-shell, which sets all terminal colors for zsh (hence also for tmux)
  according to a specific Base16 theme.
- base16-vim, which sets the colorscheme and syntax highlighting for vim
  according to a Base16 theme. This plugin syncs with the theme used by
  base16-shell automatically (this is a feature of these two plugins, plus
  some settings for base16-vim that appear in init.vim).

Usages of specific colors occurs in the following dotfiles:

- In .zshrc, we set specific colors for PS1 (i.e. the shell prompt).
- In .tmux.conf, we set specific colors for the tmux status line.
- In init.vim, we set specific colors for the vim status line.

These additional settings make use of terminal colors 0-21, which are set by
base16-shell according to the current theme.

The themes provided out-of-the-box for Base16 are already great. However, if
we find (or create) some new theme that we want to use with Base16, here's what
we need to do:

1. Create a scheme file with all the theme colors. These files are very simple:
   they are essentially just a list of the 16 colors in the theme (in a
   specific order according to the way each color will be used). For details,
   see the following links:
   https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/master/styling.md
   https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/master/file.md

2. Obtain a template file for Base16 shell themes. This comes with the
   base16-shell plugin, so it can be found either on the git repo for the plugin
   or wherever the plugin is installed locally (most likely
   ~/.config/base16-shell).

3. Use a builder on the scheme and template files to make a shell script that
   sets the theme. base16-shell says it used "Base 16 Builder PHP"; for other
   builders written in other languages (e.g. Go, Python, Rust, Ruby), see
   the Github repo for Base16:
   https://github.com/chriskempson/base16

4. In our .zshrc, run the script that the builder made.



Font Stuff
----------
Apparently, a patched font with "glyphs" can be used to get fancy-looking
"pointed blocks" instead of just rectangular blocks on the tmux and vim status
lines. I haven't looking into this yet, but a blog post I read suggested using
a font from:

https://www.nerdfonts.com/

Once we pick a font (the blog post writer uses losevka), all we have to do is
test for the existence of this font, and if it does exist, then put arrow
glyphs (I think specifically the glyph "nf-fa-caret_right" for Nerd Fonts
glyphs) on the right end of the various "blocks" in our status line formats.

I don't really know anything more than this about fonts. But maybe we could
learn a little bit and pick one that we like and that looks good (especially
one that looks good when code is displayed with it)?



Terminal Colors and base16-shell
--------------------------------
The theme scripts that base16-shell provides work by changing the colors
0-21 (inclusive) of a 256-color terminal according to the Base16 theme chosen.  
More specifically:

- Colors 0-8 are set so as to provide relatively "standard" colors to any 
  terminal application that expects to use 16 colors (e.g. color 1 is
  frequently still red, though this could vary depending on the specific theme);
- Colors 9-14 are the same as colors 1-6 (in the same order). Typically,
  9-14 are "bright" versions of 1-6; Base16 themes don't have bright versions
  of these colors, so making them the same is again a way to provide
  compatibility with terminal applications that expect the standard 16-color
  palette.
- Colors 16-21 contain the rest of the colors in the Base16 theme
  (which are typically various shades of neutral colors like gray/white/black).

As explained above, the upside to this setup is that it allows many terminal
applications to automatically make use of the Base16 theme. The downside is,
when we are making our own specific color settings (e.g. for the tmux or vim
status lines), it is somewhat harder to know what colors will be what, exactly.

To this end, I've written out some tables to convert Base16 colors to
terminal colors (and vice versa). These tables came from pulling the relevant
values out of the base16-shell template file. Usages for Base16 colors are taken
from the "Styling Guidelines" page on the Base16 Github repository. Colors listed
for the shell colors are the standard colors in most terminals, but they may
vary for different Base16 themes.
