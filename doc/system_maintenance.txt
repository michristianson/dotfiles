Dotfiles: System Maintenance Checklist

Routine maintenance of computers is something that Linux (and
especially rolling distros like Arch) has always told me to do but
that I've never developed the habit of doing consistently. To help
with this, here's a checklist for basic maintenance of a system
configured with the dotfiles in this repo.

Many of the steps here are taken from the following wiki page (which
seems to have good practices even for non-Arch systems):

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_maintenance



Regular Maintenance
-------------------
1. Push everything from Google drive as well as any git repos.

2. Check locations such as ~/bin, ~/Documents, or ~/Downloads that
   weren't backed up in Step 1 but that might contain important files.
   Back up files from these locations as needed.

3. Optionally back up other system data. For instance, the Arch wiki
   suggests backing up the list of installed packages as well as the
   package manager database. If the machine is a VM, consider backing
   up the whole machine with a snapshot. It is also possible to take
   a snapshot of a non-virtual machine; see the following link for
   details:

   https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_backup

4. Check for system errors using the systemctl and journalctl
   commands and by reviewing the Xorg logs in
   ~/.local/share/xorg (for older versions of xorg, in /var/log).
   More specifically, the Arch wiki suggests using the command

   systemctl --failed

   to list all failed system units and the command

   journalctl -p 3 -b

   to list all error messages from systemctl in the current boot that
   have priority 3. (But it also says that some important errors might
   not actually have priority 3. . .)

5. Update all system packages with the system package manager
   (by running a command like apt update, pacman -Syu, etc.)
   Some distros have specific instructions about how to update system
   packages; for instance, Arch Linux has a whole wiki page about
   recommended practices, which includes monitoring news about unusual
   updates on the Arch Linux home page. Following these distro-specific
   instructions is not a lot of fun, but it's probably still worth doing!

6. Update all zsh plugins. Currently, we don't have a package manager
   and are installing by just cloning git repos; these can be updated
   with a git pull command wherever they are cloned to.

7. Update all neovim plugins by using the command
   ":PlugUpdate | PlugUpgrade" in neovim.
   Explanation: ":PlugUpdate" command updates all plugins, the
   ":PlugUpgrade" command updates vim-plug, which is our plugin manager,
   and I think the "|" chains together the two commands (more
   specifically: there is no "piping" of output, like on the shell,
   but the second command is just executed on its own if the first
   command succeeds.)

8. Reboot the system so that all of the updates take effect.



Not-Necessarily-As-Regular Maintenance
--------------------------------------
1. Clean the filesystem. The Arch wiki page at the top of this document
   describes how to do several useful cleaning steps, namely: removing
   unused packages and cached package files;
   cleaning out unused files in ~/.config, ~/.cache, and ~/.local/share;
   and dealing with broken symlinks.

2. Clean up our own documents, e.g. those in ~/bin, ~/Downloads, or 
   ~/Documents, or those in the cloud.

3. Review dotfiles and evaluate whether current options, key-bindings,
   etc. are working well for our current workflow.

4. Review TODO's in dotfiles (and in the dotfile repo docs).
   Maybe it's time to do these so that we can have a better experience
   using our setup in the future!
